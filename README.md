# Kouklakis â€” Insights Lab

I turn messy data into stories people can act on.  
Think of this repo as my **BI & Analytics atelier**: blueprints, dbt/SQL models, and Tableau designs that turn **KPIs â†’ decisions**.

> ðŸŽ¨ Data artist with a product mindset â€” equal parts SQL/Python/Tableau and clarity, coaching, and calm under pressure.

## Whatâ€™s inside
- **Case studies**: Problem â†’ Decision â†’ Approach â†’ Impact â†’ Reusable pattern
- **Analytics-ready models**: dbt/SQL marts with tests & docs
- **Dashboard specs**: Executive Pulse, Financial Performance, Acquisition Overview (design, RLS, calc catalog)
- **Governance**: KPI glossary, QA gates, RLS patterns, naming conventions
- **Synthetic data**: generators + CSV/Parquet so you can reproduce locally
