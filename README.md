>I turn messy data into stories people can act on.  
>Think of this repo as my **BI & Analytics atelier**: blueprints, SQL models, and Tableau designs that turn **KPIs → decisions**.

🎨 Data artist with a product mindset — equal parts SQL/Python/Tableau and clarity, coaching, and calm under pressure.

**What I love**

+ ✅ Designing KPIs as a shared language (so Finance, Product & Ops finally agree 😉)
+ 📊 Building reliable dashboards that execs actually use
+ 🔁 Moving teams from “ad-hoc” to repeatable: templates, QA gates, RLS, clear SLAs

**How I work**

+ **🎯 Outcomes > outputs**: I start with the decision, not the chart
+ **🍸 Governance with taste:**
+ - One source of truth
+ - RLS
+ - Data Governance & Security Protocols
+ - Group Permissions
+ - Clean Reporting Repo
+ **🤝 Human first**: I coach, unblock, and give people room to grow, building elite professional squads

>**Stack:**
Tableau • SQL • Python • Databricks • PostgreSQL • JIRA • Confluence • Figma

Got a messy dataset, a slippery KPI, or a dashboard no one opens?
Let’s turn it into something people use. 
I’m open to smart collabs—audits, exec dashboard makeovers, KPI/glossary tune-ups, data migrations, or quick BI strategy sparring. 
Contact me today and let’s make your data sing, taking decision-making to the next level and compounding your org’s prosperity.
